That's when you saw institutional **smart/big** money get on the long side. The companies who are short want to get out of their positions but they don't want to cover at this price. They desperately want the stock to dip to $20 so they can exit their positions without a MTD portfolio loss of double digits.

We just keep track of word counts and disregard the grammatical details and the word order. It is called a “bag” of words because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document. We'll use the CountVectorizer() function from the scikit-learn library to implement the BoW model.  We'll also be excluding stopwords from our results."

    "The bigrams used within the GME subreddit suggest that the community tends to add emojis to their posts. We can also see keywords related to \"hedge funds\", \"short squeeze\" and \"AMC\". After reading up on some of the posts containing these keywords and researching, we found that the GameStop mania was a result of the tug-of-war battle between Reddit traders and hedge funds (think David vs. Goliath story) *[(source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/01/27/gamestop-stock-in-battle-between-hedge-funds-and-reddit-day-traders-melvin-capital-closes-its-short/?sh=15f6cc7c2471)*. Members of the Reddit community targeted GameStop's stock after they noticed that hedge funds were short-selling it. The community of Reddit traders encouraged each other to buy and accumulate GameStop’s shares, driving a meteoric rise in GameStop’s stock price. This process is called a short squeeze. Besides GameStop, Reddit traders also have their attention to other stocks like AMC.\n",

    "For the dogecoin subreddit, we can see keywords related to \"saturday night live\" and \"elon musk\". After reading up on some of the posts containing these keywords and researching, we found that Reddit users were mostly excited for Elon Musk's Saturday Night Live (a NBCUniversal comedy show) appearance on Saturday (May 8). This is mainly due to Elon Musk being a supporter of dogecoin *[(source)](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/elon-musk-to-send-cryptocurrency-funded-satellite-doge-1-to-moon-121051000289_1.html)* and many Reddit traders do not want to miss out on any buzz that could possibly stem from Elon Musk’s hosting of Saturday Night Live."

    "Overall, it is clear that there are common words/emojis which are frequent to both subreddits, such as 'buy', 'people', 'us', 'rocket', 'let', 'hold', 'going', 'like', 'go', 'get'. Given their high frequency in both datasets, these words may not be useful for the classification models to distinguish between the 2 subreddits. Hence, we would add them to stopword list as they are common occurences in both subreddits.\n",

Although the optimised Random Forest Classifier model using TF-IDF Vectorizer performed much better than the baseline model, it performed slightly worse off than the optimised Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF Vectorizer and the Naive Bayes model using CountVectorizer. We can see that the optimised Random Forest Classifier model using TF-IDF Vectorizer produced test results that are slightly worse off than training. This suggests slight overfitting of training data, as the model is not generalising well enough from our training data to unseen data."

    "## Overall Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with a problem statement in mind, which was to use natural language processing (NLP) to classify posts from two different subreddits based on their title and text content, we have collected posts from r/GME - GameStop Stock subreddit and r/dogecoin - Dogecoin subreddit using Pushshift's API. The posts collected were then cleaned, pre-processed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification modelling. Based on the insights from our EDA, we zoomed in on the characteristics (i.e the words usage/type of posts) of each subreddit and were able to learn more about the GameStop and Dogecoin mania.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the EDA process, we tested and evaluated three classification models - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes & Random Forest Classifier with two different NLP vectorizers - Count Vectorizer & TF-IDF Vectorizer to select the best parameters which produce the best model performance. The Naive Bayes model using CountVectorizer was then selected as our production model. Our production model is able to classify posts from the two subreddits with an F1-Score score of 96%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our production model is performing relatively well given that the two subreddits are quite similar. This simple classifier will be beneficial for Reddit as a company or even the subreddit moderators to keep the contents of each subreddit relevant to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "We would recommend the subreddit moderators of r/GME and r/dogecoin to use our model as it can correctly classify 93.61% of GME posts and 97.37% of dogecoin posts. The model hence eliminates the need for manual screening currently performed by the subreddit moderators and will free up their time to focus their expertise on more productive tasks. The subreddit moderators can also use the insights from the model to understand the overall direction of their subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, this model can be deployed to be used by the subreddit community instead. The model can be integrated into the Reddit platform/ enabled as a browser extension, to help suggest the correct subreddit for the users to publish their post.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen from the analysis done on posts that have been misclassified, our model does have some limitations as it does not work well on generic posts. Another point to note is that this model works well for recent events. The words usage/context of the subreddits could have been different in the past few years. Hence, our model would need to be retrained using more historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We could look into improving the scores further by training on more data. One way of obtaining more data is to collect more posts from GameStop Subreddit and Dogecoin Subreddit by connecting to Pushshift Reddit API. Other social media sites can also be explored, eg. Twitter, where we can search for topics on 'GameStop' and 'Dogecoin'. To further minimise our false positive and false negative, we can consider trying out a more complex model leveraging semantics by using Word2Vec and BERT. This will help us to classify our posts by linguistic relationship, with a possibility of increasing our model performance."
